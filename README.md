<h1>Blirb React Native Front End</h1>

Front end React Native interface I wrote for Blirb, an application created by myself and two friends. All code in this repo is written by me from late 2020 to mid 2021.

Blirb is an application that allows users to create groups and share their favorite media. We make it easy to create a group with your friends, search for your favorite movies, tv shows, books, and podcasts, and share your recommendations with the groups of your choosing. Blirb will then show you a main feed which collects your recommendations across all groups, and allows you to view specific group feeds.

<h1>Code</h1>
The code in this repository is all written by me and emits most of the redux store for security reasons as well as other miscellaneous files. This app was built and tested locally using expo and beta tested using testflight. Because the codebase was completely mine, standards are not adhered to.
